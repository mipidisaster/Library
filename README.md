# miLibrary

This library contains the support of a majority of devices/interaces which will be used within my "mipidisaster" projects going forward. The design of this currently only supports the following devices:
 * Raspberry Pi (using the WiringPi interface -v2.50 - visit http://wiringpi.com/)
 * STM32Fx devices
 * STM32Lx devices
   * All STM32 devices require basic configuration via STM32CubeMX -v6.2.1 - https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html
